      <p id="history-text">Linux, created by Linus Torvalds in 1991, started as a free, open-source operating system kernel. It was built on Unix principles and rapidly gained popularity among developers. Over time, it evolved with contributions from global communities, becoming a powerful alternative to proprietary systems, widely used in servers, desktops, and embedded devices.</p>
